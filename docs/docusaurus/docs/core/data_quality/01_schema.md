## Data Quality: Ensuring Schema Consistency with Great Expectations

Validating your data's schema is essential for ensuring its reliability and usability in downstream tasks. **Great Expectations (GX)** provides a powerful suite of schema-focused **Expectations** that allow you to define and enforce the structural integrity of your datasets. This guide will walk you through leveraging these Expectations to establish robust schema validation within your data pipelines.

### Key Schema Expectations

Let's explore core Expectations for schema validation, delving into their practical applications and
nuances:

**1. `expect_column_to_exist`**:
Ensures the presence of a specified column in your dataset. This Expectation is foundational for
schema validation, verifying that critical columns are included, thus preventing data processing
errors due to missing fields.

```python
dataset.expect_column_to_exist("sender_account_number")
```

*Use Case*: Ideal during data ingestion or integration of multiple data sources to ensure that
essential fields are present before proceeding with downstream processing.

*Pro Tip*: Implement this Expectation early in your data pipeline to catch missing columns as soon
as possible, minimizing downstream errors and rework.

**2. `expect_column_values_to_be_in_type_list`**:
Ensures that the values in a specified column are of types listed in a given type list. This
Expectation is flexible and caters to columns where permissible types can vary, such as mixed-type
fields often found in legacy databases.

```python
dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_in_type_list("account_type", ["int", "str"])
```
*Use Case*: Suitable for datasets transitioning from older systems where type consistency might not
be strictly enforced, aiding smooth data migration and validation.

*Pro Tip*: Combine this Expectation with detailed logging to track which types are most frequently
encountered, aiding in eventual standardization efforts.

**3. `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type`**:
Validates that the values within a column are of a specific data type. This is more stringent
compared to the previous Expectation, suitable for scenarios needing strict type adherence.

```python
dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_of_type("transfer_amount", "float")
```
*Use Case*: Critical in financial datasets where precision and type accuracy directly impact
calculations and reporting, such as ensuring all transaction amounts are recorded as floats.

*Strategic Advice*: Opt for `expect_column_values_to_be_of_type` when dealing with columns where any
type deviation could lead to significant processing errors or inaccuracies.

**4. `expect_table_column_count_to_equal`**:
Ensures the dataset has an exact number of columns. This precise Expectation is for datasets with a
fixed schema structure, providing a strong safeguard against unexpected changes.

```python
dataset.expect_table_column_count_to_equal(7)
```
*Use Case*: Perfect for regulatory reporting scenarios where the schema is strictly defined, and any
deviation can lead to compliance violations.

*Best Practice*: Periodically review and update this Expectation alongside any schema changes,
especially when new regulatory requirements emerge.

**5. `expect_table_column_to_match_ordered_list`**:
Validates the exact order of columns. This is crucial when processing pipelines depend on a specific
column order, ensuring consistency and reliability.

```python
dataset.expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list([
    "sender_account_number", "recipient_account_number",
    "transfer_amount", "transfer_date"
])
```
*Use Case*: Implement in ETL workflows where downstream tasks are sequence-dependent, ensuring the
column order remains unchanged through transformations.

*Comparison Insight*: Use `expect_table_columns_to_match_ordered_list` over
`expect_table_columns_to_match_set` when order matters, such as in scripts directly referencing
column positions.

**6. `expect_table_columns_to_match_set`**:
Checks that the dataset contains specific columns, without regard to order. This Expectation offers
flexibility where column presence is more critical than their sequence.

```python
dataset.expect_table_columns_to_match_set([
    "sender_account_number", "recipient_account_number",
    "transfer_amount", "transfer_date"
])
```
*Use Case*: Useful for datasets that might undergo reordering during preprocessing; key for data
warehousing operations where column integrity is crucial, but order might vary.

*Strategic Advice*: Opt for `expect_table_columns_to_match_set` when integrating datasets from
various sources where column order might differ, but consistency in available data is required.

**7. `expect_table_column_count_to_be_between`**:
Validates that the number of columns falls within a specific range, offering flexibility for
datasets that can expand or contract within a known boundary.

```python
dataset.expect_table_column_count_to_be_between(min_value=5, max_value=7)
```
*Use Case*: Beneficial for evolving datasets where additional columns could be added over time, but
the general structure remains bounded within a predictable range.

*Best Practice*: Regularly review the allowed range as your dataset evolves, ensuring it aligns with
business requirements and anticipates potential future expansion.

### Integrating Schema Validation

To incorporate these Expectations into your data pipelines:

**1. Define Expectations**:
Expectations are assertions about your dataset. Utilize `.expect_*` methods to specify schema rules.
```python
# Examples of defining expectations
dataset.expect_column_to_exist("sender_account_number")
dataset.expect_column_values_to_be_of_type("transfer_amount", "float")
```

**2. Save Expectations**:
Once defined, save these as an **Expectation Suite** for future reference and validation.
```python
dataset.save_expectation_suite()
```

**3. Create Checkpoints**:
**Checkpoints** bundle your Expectations to validate your data at specific points within your pipeline. They encapsulate the process of executing validations.
```python
checkpoint = context.add_or_update_checkpoint(name="checkpoint", validator=dataset)
```

**4. Run Validation**:
Triggering a Checkpoint will run through the Expectations and validate your dataset against them.
```python
checkpoint_result = checkpoint.run()
```

**5. Review Results**:
After running the Checkpoint, you can inspect the validation outcomes and address any discrepancies.
```python
context.view_validation_result(checkpoint_result)
```

**Context**:
Great Expectations revolves around the **Context**, a central object that manages everything from Expectation Suites to the configuration of data sources and validation results.

### Conclusion

Robust schema validation is fundamental to trustworthy data pipelines. Great Expectations empowers you to proactively define and enforce the structural integrity of your data, ensuring its reliability for critical analyses and decision-making processes. By incorporating these schema validation practices, you enhance data quality, reduce downstream errors, and foster a culture of data confidence within your organization.
